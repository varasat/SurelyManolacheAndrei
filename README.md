##Documentation 
### Setup 
- Download this git repository
- Setup Symfony 3.4 : I included the symfony install file for ease of use
- open a console and navigate to the /my_coding_test folder
- run php bin/console server:run and the coding test should be present at http://localhost:8000/

- use the SQL dump in symfony_test_database.sql to create the database
- edit the database details in parameters.yml accordingly 

### Task assigned and how it was tackled 
Build a "To Do List" sample application using the Symfony framework that can list, add, edit and delete "To Do" list items. Include an item description and due date fields as a minimum.

To simplify the understanding of this documentation I will refer to items on the To do list as reminders

The following technology stack was used : 
- Symfony forms alongside twig folders : The ease of use of symfony forms justified this choice
- Symfony controller and service : To make the code more readable, to adhere to best practices and to have an all around coherent codebase
- MySQL database 

Version of Symfony used : 3.4




Use best practices where possible and add comments where you are aware of any technical shortcomings.
